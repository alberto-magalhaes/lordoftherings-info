# Lord of the Rings - info

Hello, this a simple application implemented using the [The One API](https://the-one-api.dev/). 

It uses the following technologies/libraries:
> Retrofit

> OkHttp

> Jetpack Navigation

> Room

> Coroutines

> Koin


You can download the apk [here](https://mega.nz/file/xyoASTTT#Uw-2FDrjrANe_mLMyfLGmT9LzAarRBXJutH1MCFppa0) or, if you want, clone it to your Android Studio and run in a emulator. In order to do this, clone the project (you can copy this https://github.com/alberto-magalhaes/lordoftherings-info.git to your clipboard), click on "GET FROM VCS" option right after opening your Android Studio.

and then click on "CLONE" option. Usually it should be the only steps necessary to setup the project in your machine, but if you use an older version you might need to update the Android SDK Platform to latest versions.
